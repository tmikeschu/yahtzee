# Yahtzee: My First Programming Love

Within my first few weeks of learning to program, I came across a section of Chris Pine's [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) that called for making a `Die` class in Ruby.

I worked through adding simple random number methods and instantiating a bunch of dice, and then it occured to me:

> I wonder how you could make a Yahtzee program...

Within this first few minutes of implementing a Yahtzee REPL, I knew that I had found a craft that I truly love. I pinned this repository because it represents the turning point in my life that led me to a career as a software developer.

I may get around to refactoring this and adding some tests, but the whole point of this is to show and own some code that may not be pretty, but was written with excitement and wonder.

### Setup

So simple: clone, `cd`, and `ruby yahtzee.rb`.
